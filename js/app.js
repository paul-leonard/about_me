/* Guessing Game about Paul
Lab02 Feature Task List:  *****************************************************
- need 5 yes/no questions
- accept y/n; yes/no answers
- answers are not case sensitive
- alert a response to let the user know if they got the question correct
- - console.log() messages during development
- - - comment out the console.log()'s prior to code submission
- - - add in alert()'s to replace the functionality of the conosole.log()'s
- ask the user their name
- personal greeting
- personal goodbye

Question Plan:
Q1: Does Paul like cookies?
Q2: Does Paul like ice cream?
Q3: Does Paul like airplanes?
Q4: Does Paul like backpacking?
Q5: Does Paul like fishing?

Program Layout:
- Welcome, what's your name?
- 5 questions
- Personal Goodbye

Layout repeated for each question:
- prompt user with a question
- get answer
- change answer to all lower case
- use if/else statements to determine if the answer was correct
- use logical ORs because answers could come in any case and will be the form of yes/no/y/n
- output a response to user with alert() function


Lab03 Feature Task List:  *****************************************************
- update README
- create top ten ordered list at bottom
- convert work experience section to be an unordered list
- convert education section to be an unordered list
- 6th question to guess a numerical answer
-- (What was Paul's rec league hockey jersey number? 22)
-- give too high and too low hints
-- provide 4 chances to get it right
--- if incorrect after 4, tell them the correct
--- consider using a loop
- 7th question to guess a categorical question/answer with multiple correct answers available
-- (Can you guess one of Paul's favorite 3 fruits from this list?)
-- give the user 6 attempts
-- guesses end if answer is right or out of guesses
-- display all correct answers at end
-- consider using a loop
- tally and report quiz score
- use console.log()'s for trouble shooting
- improve CSS
- 3 stretch goals available

Known bugs:
- if you hit cancel, it puts a null in the prompt answers. This causes null being sent to parseInt() which causes a JS error. Proposed fix: define all UserAnswers early and assign answers to a value... maybe 3?
