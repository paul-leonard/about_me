### About Paul Leonard

#### Summary of Website
This website will offer background information on me in regards to geographical origins, educational background, and professional experience.  The site will build a personal relationship with the user through interactive questions, prompts, and quizzes.  The underlying intent of this website is to practice creating a website that requires HTML, CSS, and JS.

#### Features Added in Version2 as Part of Lab03
- new top ten list of favorite TV shows
- converted work experience section to be an unordered list
- converted education section to be an unordered list
- 6th question added to guess hockey jersey number
- 7th question added to guess one of top three favorite fruits
- tally and report quiz score
- CSS improvements

#### Author
Paul Leonard

#### Pair Programming Lab 04 Session
- Questions 1 - 7 refactored into functions with their calls placed below in group.
- Navigator: Paul Leonard
- Driver: Jack Nelson

#### Links and Resources
Below are some helpful links and resources used in producing this website.
- [Code 201 class repo](https://github.com/codefellows/seattle-201d65)
- My Code 201 class notes
- [Setting Up Code 201 Projects](https://codefellows.github.io/code-201-guide/curriculum/class-02/project_setup)

#### Use of Tools
- .eslintrc.json is used as published on the [class GitHub repo](https://github.com/codefellows/seattle-201d65).
- [Eric Meyer's reset.css file](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/)
- The JavaScript 'use strict' command was used to ensure proper programming syntax was followed. 

#### Known bugs
- if you hit cancel, it puts a null in the prompt answers. This causes null being sent to parseInt() which causes a JS error. Proposed fix: define all UserAnswers early and assign answers to a value... maybe 3?

## About Me (within a README for a website about me)
Thank you for visiting my page of notes.  I hope they were helpful to you.  Please also check out [my GitHub portfolio page](https://github.com/paul-leonard "Paul's GitHub Portfolio").

After graduating with a mechanical engineering degree from *Missouri University of Science and Technology* 13 years ago, I moved out to Seattle and started work at Boeing.  While there, I worked in airplane modifications, flight test, and flight controls design engineering.  I am super excited to return to a rich learning environment and gain some new programming skills.  I plan to complete the full course path ending with a specialty in Python.  I enjoy spending time outside by camping and hiking or having a beer at a brewery with friends (when that is a thing again).
