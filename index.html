        <h3>Short Bio</h3>
        <p>After growing up in St. Louis, I moved to Rolla, MO to attend college.  Upon receiving a   degree in mechanical engienering, I moved to Seattle for a position with Boeing.  I have  thoroughly enjoyed living in the Pacific Northwest and enjoy many of the things it has to  offer.  Some of my favorites include the vast outdoors to explore, the vibrant city life, tasty  and diverse food, and all of the local micro breweries.</p>
